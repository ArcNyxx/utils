utils - simple utilities
========================
utils is a compilation of scripts written in compiled languages.

Installation
------------
utils comes with a Makefile and config.mk file for configurable building and
testing.  Edit the latter to match your local setup (utils are installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default, you may need to modify your $PATH).

utils can be built and installed with the following command (run as root):

    make clean [util...] install
